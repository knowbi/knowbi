# knowbi

know.bi is a team of data engineers and consultants with a very strong Apache Hop affinity as developers, implementers and sponsors since the project’s inception. know.bi has a long track record as one of Europe’s most experienced Pentaho implementors.

In addition to Apache Hop, know.bi specializes in Neo4j and Vertica.

Know.bi primary focus is to add value to our customer’s data, with technology as a means to an end. We have an "open source first" approach, since we strongly believe open source and an open mindset are prerequisites to build solutions that are as innovative as robust. Our main platforms are Apache Hop, since all data needs orchestration, and Neo4j, because all data is connected.

We are based in Belgium but operate globally.
